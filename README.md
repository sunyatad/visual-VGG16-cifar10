# visual-VGG16-cifar10
Python script demonstrating the use of VGG16, a pre-trained CNN, for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It employs transfer learning, early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpointing with TensorFlow and Keras.

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of the VGG16 model, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The script utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries, and includes steps for data loading, pre-processing, model definition, training, and evaluation. Furthermore, it implements useful model training strategies such as transfer learning, early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpointing to save the best performing model during training. This project is aimed at those interested in practicing their deep learning and computer vision skills, or anyone who wishes to understand how to use pre-trained models and TensorFlow in a practical setting.
